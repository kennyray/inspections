# Inspections Laravel App

I wrote this app recently, while learning Laravel 5. The idea was to consume the data 
generated by my Inspections-Importer app. You will need to install that code first,
and setup the DB, and import the data first. Once you do, you can run this app, and 
browse all the data.

I left off with the location gathering on the home page. The idea was going to be to
allow the user to type in their location, or have the system locate them automatically.
Then the list would filter on their region only. But I have stopped working on this
app since I discovered that the state already has an app which gives the same info
I was trying to display. I am not into re-inventing the wheel.

Feel free to use this as a learning tool, or anything else you'd like.
